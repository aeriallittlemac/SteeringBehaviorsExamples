Observations(test 1 = test 10):
AI isn't very good at chasing the player, often tags other AIs
The key the scoring high is the first contact, the faster the first contact is the earlier the player can start scoring points
"Velocity tweak" is a parameter that can be seen in multiple behaviors, but seems to have little to no impact.

Modifications(tests 10 - 30):
The wander and evade function seems to work: I've dragged the "target" gameobject into the "evaded" parameter.
The obstacle avoider seems to help in the player not getting stuck on the walls.
I'm tweaking these parameters, including using very extreme numbers, but none of them really seem to make a difference?

Result:
Able to consistently improve score by 500 - 1000 points
